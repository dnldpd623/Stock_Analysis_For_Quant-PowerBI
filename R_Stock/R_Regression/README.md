### Regression Analysis is a statistical method that explore the relationship between two or more variables. There many different types of regression analysis; however, they all have one or more independent variables on a dependent variable.  
### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a linear model or linear regression algorithm, and mostly common used. The linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). 
Use this model to predict numerical such as continuous and discrete data.  

(1) Simple Linear Regression – Single input variable (x)  
(2) Multiple Linear Regression – Multiple input variables (x)
