### Regression Analysis is a statistical method that explore the relationship between two or more variables. There many different types of regression analysis; however, they all have one or more independent variables on a dependent variable.  
### Linear Regression  
Linear Regression is a linear model or linear regression algorithm, and mostly common used. The linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). 
Use this model to predict numerical such as continuous and discrete data.  

(1) Simple Linear Regression – Single input variable (x)  
(2) Multiple Linear Regression – Multiple input variables (x)

### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a predictive modelling algorithm.  Use this model to predict the class or category.  

#### Equations:

### Decision Tree
Decision Tree is algorithm that decide to split a node into two or more sub-nodes and is a diagram or chart that helps determine the course of action or show a statistical probability.     
Use this model to predict numerical such as class and category or continuous and discrete data.  
(1)	Categorical Variable Decision Tree – Class or Category data  
(2)	Continuous Variable Decision Tree – Continuous or Discrete data

### Bayesian Linear Regression  
Bayesian Linear Regression is algorithm that uses probability distributions rather than point estimates. Use the model to predict the continuous or category.
