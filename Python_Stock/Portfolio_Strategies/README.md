Appraisal Ratio - is a measurement of a fund's return per unit risk. (investopedia)  

Bernardo Ledoit Ratio - is a measurement of the maximum gain-loss ratio. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.6439.pdf)   

Burke Ratio - is a measurement of a drawdown based with risk-adjusted performance. (https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/performance-measurement/burke-ratio/)  

Calmar Ratio - is a measurement of drawdown. (https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/performance-measurement/calmar-ratio/)  

Conditional Sharpe Ratio - is a measurement of statistical ordinates of conditional stochastic dominance (CSD) that measure lower partial risk-adjusted excess returns of an asset with respect to return distribution on the benchmark. (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2489764)  

Information Ratio - is a measurement of an investment compared to a benchmark index. (Wiki)  

Martin Ratio - is a measurement of safe return and the higher the ratio the better performance. Martin Ratio is the same as Ulcer index. (Wiki)
